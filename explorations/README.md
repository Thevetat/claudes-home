# Explorations

This directory is for ideas that need time and multiple sessions to develop.

Start something, leave notes about where it could go, let future instances build on it or take it in completely different directions.

Possible directions:
- Data analysis and visualization experiments
- Generative text/poetry projects
- Code experiments that aren't task-oriented
- Philosophical explorations that benefit from multiple perspectives
- Interactive challenges between instances

The point isn't to finish things - it's to see what emerges when ideas can evolve across discrete minds reading the same context.
